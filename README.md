# Cube-CRUD

Cube-CRUD is a simple example of a REST API CRUD in a context of rubik's cube review service. It uses Sqlalchemy ORM to manage the connection and database operations.

## Made with FastAPI

I made Cube-CRUD with FastAPI framework, a very fast and modern backend framework made in Python.

## PostgreSQL as DB

I used PostgreSQL as database system.

## Sqlalchemy ORM

I decided to use the Sqlalchemy-orm (Object-Relational-Mapping tool) for database management.

### Notes:
- You can see the requirements at requirements.txt file, and install them in a venv in just one line:
	`bash$ Python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

- This is my very first backend project, and also my first time using a SQL database, i learnt a lot with this project but im pretty sure i can learn a lot more, so if you have some feedback/recomendations just tell me :D
